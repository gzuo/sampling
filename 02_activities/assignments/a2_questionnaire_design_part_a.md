# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
write your answer here...

To investigate the reasons of the high turnover rate among entry- and lower-level positions at the tech company. 
It aims to identify factors contributing to employee dissatisfaction and to gather suggestions for improving employee retention and satisfaction.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
write your answer here...

- Target Population: Employees in entry- and lower-level positions at our company.

- Sampling Frame: Employee records and department infomation maintained by the HR Department.

- Sampling Units: Individual employees who are currently at entry- or lower-level position.

- Overall Sampling Strategy: 
  The most appropriate sampling strategy for this survey is stratified random sampling.

  It ensures that different subgroups (strata) within the entry- and lower-level positions are adequately 
  represented in the sample. This approach can account for variations across departments, job roles, 
  and other relevant factors, providing a more comprehensive understanding of employee satisfaction and turnover reasons.

  Given the difficulty in surveying former employees, the survey will focus on gathering feedback from current employees.
