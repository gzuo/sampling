# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    If the stratified random sampling is implemented effectively and efforts are made to achieve a high response rate, 
    the survey has a good chance of being representative of the target population. However, potential biases need to be 
    monitored and addressed to ensure the accuracy and representativeness of the survey results.

    The reasons are as follows.
     - Stratified Random Sampling: By using stratified random sampling, I aim to ensure that all relevant subgroups 
     (e.g., departments, job roles, tenure) within the entry- and lower-level positions are adequately represented. 
     This increases the likelihood that the survey results will be representative of the target population.
     - Clear and Specific Questions: The survey questions are designed to be clear, specific, and relevant to the factors 
     that might influence job satisfaction and turnover. This helps in collecting accurate and meaningful data.
     - Closed-Ended Questions: The use of closed-ended questions makes it easier for respondents to answer and provides 
     quantifiable data that can be analyzed statistically.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    write your answer here...

    Yes, considering the sampling factors of error, survey quality, and ethics, I would make the following changes to enhance the survey:

     - Include Likert Scales: For questions about satisfaction, use a 5-point Likert scale to provide more nuanced responses. 
        On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with your current role and responsibilities? 
        - 1 (Very Dissatisfied) 
        - 2 (Dissatisfied)
        - 3 (Neutral) 
        - 4 (Satisfied) 
        - 5 (Very Satisfied)


     - Randomize Question Order: To minimize order bias, randomize the order of questions for each respondent.

     - Add an additional question:
        Have you ever communicated suggestions regarding improvements to the work environment and employee benefits to the HR team or management?
        - Yes
        - No

    I've updated the survey, [Link] (https://github.com/gzuo/sampling/blob/a3_questionnaire_design_part_b/02_activities/assignments/a2_questionnaire_design_part_a.md)
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    write your answer here...

    No. An observational study could provide some insights into the factors affecting employee satisfaction and turnover.
    However, it does not provide direct insights into employees' feelings and thoughts. While behaviors can be observed, 
    the underlying reasons for those behaviors, such as personal job satisfaction or dissatisfaction, remain unknown.
    It would not fully fulfill the purpose of understanding the reasons behind high turnover and identifying specific improvements needed to enhance employee satisfaction. 
    Direct feedback from employees through surveys or interviews is crucial to gain comprehensive and actionable insights.

    ```

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
